# snappy-cuda

This is a CUDA port of [snappy-c](https://github.com/andikleen/snappy-c), which in turn is a port of Google's snappy compression/decompression (https://github.com/google/snappy).


Some results from  compression/decompression experiments are discussed in our [USENIX ATC'21 publication](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc21-nider.pdf)
